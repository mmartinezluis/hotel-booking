# Project: Hotel Booking

## Introduction
Hi, welcome to my Hotel Booking project. This is the third project in Flatiron school's curriculum sequence. The project involves using Ruby on Rails to build an application that processes data through complex forms using RESTful routes and the MVC framework. Some of the project requirements include: nested forms, nested routes, scope methods, using OmniAuth for user sign in, and proper handling and displaying of errors. 

## Functionality
Hotel Booking uses the [Amadeus Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search) that comprises more than 150,000 hotels worldwide. The Amadeus API finds the cheapest hotels for a given location. The following are the user stories for Hotel Booking:

* Users can log in to the app by creating a new user account or by using authentication through their Google accounts.
* Users can search for hotel reservations by a given city, check-in date, checkout-date, and number of guests in real-time.
* Users can verify the availability of a given hotel reservation in real-time.
* Users can book a reservation (feature managed by ActiveRecord; reservations are valid at time of booking but booking is not real). 
* Users can browse their visited cities and hotels.
* Users can create a new review for past hotel reservations.
* Users can edit their reviews.

Hotel Booking is under development, and it currenlty supports the following functionalities:
* Users can find hotel reservations by a given city in real-time. 
* Users can verify the availability of a reservation in real-time and can book a reservation. (Achieved: May 17)
* Users can find hotel reservations by location, checkin date, checkout date, and number of guests. (Achieved: May 18)
* Users can see the list of cities where they have reservations.
* Users can select a city to see the list of hotels that include booked reservations.
* Users can select a hotel to see the hotel's description and their booked reservations at that hotel.
* For a given booked hotel, users can see their upcoming and/or previous reservations. 
* Users can see all of their reservations. (Achieved: May 22)
* Users can write a review for past reservations; users can see their review for a given reservation. (Achieved: May 23)
* Users can see all of their reviews; hotels display users' reviews. (Achieved: May 25)
* Users can write a new review and select a previous reservation that is open for review.
* Writing a review from a reservation automatically loads the reservation to the new review form. (Achieved: June 1)

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, make sure you have Rails and Git installed on your machine. Clone the repo to your local machine:
``` javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/mmartinezluis/hotel-booking.git
```

Install the needed gems:
``` javascript
$ bundle install
```

Follow Amadeus' Self-Service APIs [instructions](https://developers.amadeus.com/get-started/get-started-with-self-service-apis-335) to obtain an Amadeus API key and secret.

Create a new file in the main directory of this repository in your local machine called

```
.env
```

Then, in this `.env` file include the following lines, replacing "API_KEY" and "API_SECRET" with your API key and API secret, respectively:

```
AMADEUS_API_KEY = API_KEY

AMADEUS_API_SECRET = API_SECRET
```

Run the application migrations's through:
``` javascript
