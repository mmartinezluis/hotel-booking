# Hotel Booking
Hi, welcome to Hotel Booking. This is the third milestone project for Flatiron school's software engineering program. The project involves using Ruby on Rails to build an application that processes data through complex forms using RESTful routes and the MVC framework. Some of the project requirements include: nested forms, nested routes, scope methods, using OmniAuth for user authentication, and proper handling and displaying of errors. You can find a Medium article for Hotel Booking [here](https://luis-mmartinez.medium.com/using-an-external-api-in-your-ruby-on-rails-application-d560ab410801).

## Functionality
Hotel Booking uses the [Amadeus Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search) that comprises more than 150,000 hotels worldwide. The Amadeus API finds the cheapest hotels for a given location. In Hotel Booking users have the ability to:

* Log in to the app by creating a new user account or by OmniAuth authentication through their Google accounts.
* Search for hotel reservations by a given city, check-in date, checkout-date, and number of guests in real-time.
* Book a hotel reservation in real-time (note: reservations are valid in real-time at moment of booking but booking occurs within the app only). 
* Browse a list of the cities of their booked hotels.
* Browse a list of their booked hotels.
* See a list of their booked hotels at a given city upon click on a city name. 
* See their upcoming and/or previous reservations for a given hotel upon click on the hotel name.
* Write a review for past hotel reservations.
* Edit or delete their hotel reviews. 
* Browse a list of their reservations.
* Some more features ...

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, make sure you have Rails installed on your machine. 
1, Clone the repo to your local machine:
``` ruby
$ git clone https://github.com/mmartinezluis/hotel-booking.git
```

2. Install the needed gems:
``` ruby
$ bundle install
```

3. Follow Amadeus' Self-Service APIs [instructions](https://developers.amadeus.com/get-started/get-started-with-self-service-apis-335) to obtain an Amadeus API key and secret.

4. Create a new file in the main directory of this repository in your local machine called `.env`

5. Then, in this `.env` file include the following lines, replacing "MY_API_KEY" and "MY_API_SECRET" with your API key and API secret, respectively:

```
AMADEUS_API_KEY = MY_API_KEY

AMADEUS_API_SECRET = MY_API_SECRET
```

6. Run the application migrations's through:
``` ruby
$ rails db:migrate
```

7. Finally, on the root path run a local server:
``` ruby
$ rails server
```
8. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to run the app.
